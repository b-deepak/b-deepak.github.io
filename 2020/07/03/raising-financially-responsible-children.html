    <p>This are some of the golden nuggets from an excellent financial independence podcast by <a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/7539545/height/90/theme/custom/autoplay/no/autonext/no/thumbnail/yes/preload/no/no_addthis/no/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/">JL Collins, Jane Collins, and Doug Nordman</a>.</p>

<h2 id="grocery-matters">Grocery Matters</h2>

<p>Once in a while, let your kids pay for grocery in cash to make them understand how money exchange works.</p>

<h2 id="allowance">Allowance:</h2>

<p>Give your kids allowance and “advise” them to save at least 50% in savings. The older they grow the more they would appreciate their savings balance. Carefully monitor the other 50% spent to determine the type of expenses and don’t step on their freedom entirely.</p>

<h2 id="nature-vs-nurture">Nature vs Nurture</h2>

<p>Put faith and trust your kids. Lectures do not work, trust does!</p>

<h2 id="need-vs-want">Need vs Want</h2>

<p>When buying something, question whether it is a need or a want? Make them understand the difference and why frugality always pays off in the longer run.</p>

<h2 id="pseudo-401k-for-kids">Pseudo-401k for Kids</h2>

<p>Match up their savings contribution every month just like a regular 401k. This will plant the importance of retirement savings when they start earning.</p>

<p>This also teaches the power of Compound Interest at an early age. For example, telling your 6 year kid to save for 10 years allows him/her to pay for their car at 16, is mind-blowing to them.</p>

<h2 id="more-tips">More Tips</h2>

<p>Model your own behavior, kids copy their parents for 90% of learnings. Conversations will matter only 10%.</p>

<p>Let them make mistakes. Let them learn from failing at home (a safer place) with their money.</p>

<h2 id="budgeting-formula">Budgeting Formula</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A dollar per week X kid’s age</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$1 X 1 week X 6 year old = $6/week = $24/month

Now help them with their budget:

Spend $12 on their discretionary things like toys, candies, books, videos etc.

Save the other $12 in an interest savings account, match their contribution.
