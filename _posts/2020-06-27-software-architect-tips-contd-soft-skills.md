# Meeting Tips

Prepare diligently in advance to make your case (esp. for important meetings)

# Leadership Tips

- Keep it simple, concise and tailor context to the stakeholders
- For Complex Diagrams - Make a high level and then "peel the onion" by separate the components in separate slide/zoom-in
- Be pragmatic, yet visionary
- Aim for success, not perfection
- Lead by example, not by title. Contribute hands-on but communicate the amount of commitment in advance to business stakeholders. Don't lose the perception of being an architect.
- Share the credit
- Be decisive and justify the decision.
- Stay positive and get along with people

# Team Structure

- Make yourself available
- Conway's Law
- Solution:
  - Inverse Conway's Manuever - Create Cross Functional Teams
  - Build products, not projects
  - Leverage [Consumer Driven Contracts](https://thoughtworks.github.io/pacto/patterns/cdc/) for internal integrations

# Negotiation Skills

- Gather as much information from requirements before entering a negotiation
- If all else fails, pivot to cost and time factors
- Demonstrate your findings
- Techniques
  - Architectural trade-off based on functional and non-functional requirements
  - Developer Buy-in

# Architecture Boundaries

- Define architecture and design principles
- IMP: **Justify** your decisions and **Communicate**!
- Guide the team. Examples:
  - Libraries/Framework choices
  - Pattern Governance
  - Defining Scope

# Remember # C's of Architecture

- Collaboration
- Communication
- Clarity
