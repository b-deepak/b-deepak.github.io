This are some of the golden nuggets from an excellent financial independence podcast by [JL Collins, Jane Collins, and Doug Nordman](https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/7539545/height/90/theme/custom/autoplay/no/autonext/no/thumbnail/yes/preload/no/no_addthis/no/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/).

## Grocery Matters

Once in a while, let your kids pay for grocery in cash to make them understand how money exchange works.

## Allowance:

Give your kids allowance and "advise" them to save at least 50% in savings. The older they grow the more they would appreciate their savings balance. Carefully monitor the other 50% spent to determine the type of expenses and don't step on their freedom entirely.

## Nature vs Nurture

Put faith and trust your kids. Lectures do not work, trust does!

## Need vs Want

When buying something, question whether it is a need or a want? Make them understand the difference and why frugality always pays off in the longer run.

## Pseudo-401k for Kids

Match up their savings contribution every month just like a regular 401k. This will plant the importance of retirement savings when they start earning.

This also teaches the power of Compound Interest at an early age. For example, telling your 6 year kid to save for 10 years allows him/her to pay for their car at 16, is mind-blowing to them.

## More Tips

Model your own behavior, kids copy their parents for 90% of learnings. Conversations will matter only 10%.

Let them make mistakes. Let them learn from failing at home (a safer place) with their money.

## Budgeting Formula

> **A dollar per week X kid's age**

```
$1 X 1 week X 6 year old = $6/week = $24/month

Now help them with their budget:

Spend $12 on their discretionary things like toys, candies, books, videos etc.

Save the other $12 in an interest savings account, match their contribution.
```
